# Polymorphism : To exist in different states. The same object or thing changing its state from one form to another is known as polymorphic. A same function or method, being used differently in different scenarios can perfectly describe polymorphism. It occurs mostly with base and derived class.  


#Example :
len("Python") # returns 6 as result
len([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) # returns 9 as result

# The len() method returns the length of an object. In this case, the function len() is polymorphic as it is taking a string as input in the first case which returns total length/characters of the string and in the second case, it is taking list as input.
