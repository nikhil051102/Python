# 1) Difference between set.remove() and set.discard()
# we want to remove 'x' from set1 in which 'x' is not present, if we perform this action by set1.discard(x) then it will not throw error and program will continue but while performing s1.remove(x) then program will throw error and terminate program because x is not present
